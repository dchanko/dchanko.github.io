Using Jupyter Notebook.

## Anaconda

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is included in the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) installation.

## Running

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will start a webserver serving up Jupyter Notebook.  The files displayed will be relative to the current directory.
